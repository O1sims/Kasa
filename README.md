# Kasa

## Description

Kasa is a Python-based web application that analyses current house prices to detect price imperfections. This application provides prospective house-buyers a way to investigate whether the houses they are purchasing are incorrectly valued based on social, economic, and geographic characteristics such as current wage levels, the price of similar houses in neighbouring areas, nearby amenities, and the estate agent selling the house. The aim is to provide more information, and therefore sovereignty, to potential consumers or even just to help overcome buyers remorse. 

## Technology stack

This application uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) as the backend web application framework and [Angular](https://angular.io/) as the frontend framework. Documentation of the RESTful API service is handled by [Swagger](https://swagger.io/). Development is done with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). We use [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) as our main database. Our language of choice is [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) for any statistical research.
